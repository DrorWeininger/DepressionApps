meta-analysis analyses the impact of app based psychological interventions on
depressive symptoms in individuals with depression. Depression is already
highly prevalent worldwide, and by 2030 it's expected to become the world's
leading contributor to the global disease burden. It is characterized by a wide
range of symptoms, which significantly impact an individual's functioning. Most
of those who suffer from depression do not receive treatment, with barriers
ranging from geographical and financial to societal. <span style='color:black'>(Strawbridge
et al., 2022) </span>showed that among those who are diagnosed with a major
depressive episode, around 38% do not receive any treatment.</span></p>

major advantages of app-based interventions are the enhancement of patients’
autonomy, the lower cost compared to seeing a therapist, the prevention of
relapse and the overall higher availability. Many apps claim to have a positive
effect on mental health. However, this is unaccounted for by most of them. Most
mental health apps are not tested in clinical settings, and some may even
promote ineffective or harmful practices <span style='color:black'>(Baumel et
al., 2020)</span>. Therefore, scientific evaluation is crucial to determine whether
app-based psychological interventions effectively reduce depressive symptoms.</span></p>

interventions delivered through smartphone apps on depressive symptoms. Most of
these interventions included either standalone Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
(CBT) or CBT combined with cognitive control therapy, positive psychology,
brief behavioral activation or mindfulness and acceptance-based therapy. To our
and the author's knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to focus
exclusively on randomized controlled trials in which a smartphone application
serves as the main therapeutic component for patients with depression. </span></p>

et al. analyzed the impact of app-based psychological interventions for
reducing depressive symptoms in people with depression. To do this they
summarized 12 studies that measured the effects of smartphone apps which were
developed with the aim of reducing depression compared to a control group. The
studies were published between the years 2015-2020 and contained data from a
total sample of 2018 participants with depressive symptoms ranging from
mild-to-moderate to moderate-to-severe. To be included in the meta-analysis,
the studies were required to be empirical studies that examined the impact of
smartphone app based interventions on depressive symptoms, using a
random-controlled trials design. Participants in all studies were to be diagnosed
with depressive symptoms using valid and reliable measures, and the smartphone
apps used in the interventions were required to be either the only or a central
component of the intervention. For the full screening and inclusion process,
see figure 1. Two studies which were included in the systematic review were
excluded from the meta-analysis due to the lack of data for the calculation of
an effect size <span style='color:black'>(Arean et al., 2016; Pratap et al.,
2018)</span>. The two studies pursued more methodological questions about the
feasibility of researching the effects of smartphone apps on depressive
symptoms, and did not look into the effects of those per-se. Thus, the data
presented in those studies wasn't suitable for goals of the current
meta-analysis, although they provided some other interesting insights regarding
compliance with the app protocol.</span></p>

effectiveness of the apps (β = −0.49), with moderate to severely depressed
patients benefiting more from the apps. All other 6 moderators such as
intervention type, duration, components etc. were found insignificant, which
doesn’t allow to draw conclusions regarding what makes a mental health app
successful in reducing depressive symptoms. Thus, although the meta-analysis
gives us some information about the conditions required for the success of an
application-based intervention, there is much more that should be discovered
before they can be optimally utilized and be adapted to the needs of patients.</span></p>

way to interpret the lack of moderators is as an evidence of the stability of
the effects found in the meta-analysis. It seems that the effects of the
different apps were robust across different variations, assessment methods of
depression, psychotherapeutic methods etc. On the other hand, some limitations
such as the lack of quality data, risks of bias in the studies and overall low
compliance rates caused the authors to be reluctant to give significant
recommendations for clinicians regarding the clinical use of apps as part of
therapy, and more prone to advice for further research before more decisive
conclusions can be drawn <span style='color:black'>(Serrano-Ripoll et al.,

meta-analysis suggests that therapeutic apps are worthy of further research and
development, but also that the current knowledge is not enough to draw
conclusions about the general depressive population.</span></p>

randomized controlled trials in which a smartphone app serves as the main
therapeutic component for patients with depression. As outlined in the
introduction, depression is a leading and increasingly prevalent cause of
disability and suicide worldwide. Many individuals face financial, geographical
or societal barriers when seeking traditional therapy. Smartphone applications
have the potential to overcome these barriers and offer low-cost, on-demand therapy
that can be personalized to the patients' needs regarding location, duration
and frequency.&nbsp; The results of this analysis indicate that psychological
interventions delivered through smartphone apps can be effective in the
treatment of depression. These findings indicate the need for further
development and evaluation of high-quality digital interventions.&nbsp; </span></p>

to the transparent research design and the rigorous procedure, this
meta-analysis can be considered methodologically reliable. To identify relevant
studies, six major databases were searched with the use of well-defined Medical
Subjects Headings and free-text terms. To minimize selection bias, two
reviewers independently screened the titles, abstracts and full texts for the
study selection. The data extraction and the risk-of-bias assessments were also
performed independently with standardized tools such as the Cochrane Risk of
Bias and ROBINS-I. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and the Begg
and Egger Test. Disagreements or discrepancies during those steps were resolved
by reaching a consensus or involving a third reviewer. For statistical
analysis, a random-effects model was used, and sensitivity analyses were
conducted to assess the robustness of the pooled results. Some minor
discrepancies were noted, such as unclear descriptions of a few screening
criteria that were reportedly violated, however, it is not clear how and if
they were violated at all. Additionally, there was some confusion regarding the
discrepancy between the 12 studies included in the systematic review and the
final 10 studies used in the meta-analysis. </span></p>

can moderately reduce depressive symptoms when used as the primary therapeutic
component. Given the various barriers when seeking traditional care, digital
interventions have the potential to offer therapy that is available on demand,
location independent and cost-effective. This potential is especially relevant
for patients in remote or lower-income areas. </span></p>

margin-left:3.0cm;text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>However,
based on these results, it is not possible to recommend individual apps, since
the evidence for that is limited in both quality and quantity. Future research
should further investigate the impact of digital interventions on depressive
symptoms and thoroughly test the safety and effectiveness of both current and
future apps with clinical trials. Future app development should focus on
personalization within apps or features for specific patient groups.
Additionally, there should be a collaboration between developers, health care
professionals and policymakers in order to attempt the integration of digital
interventions in existing health systems. With enough evidence, smartphone apps
could become a valuable complement to traditional therapy and contribute to a
healthier population.</span></p>

potential of smartphone app interventions in relieving depression symptoms in
clinically diagnosed patients with major depression disorder. The participants
in the intervention group gained access to the Kokoro app, a CBT app that is
based on a dialogue between two cartoon characters and additional practical
exercises, alongside antidepressant treatment which was given to all
participants. All participants were medication resistant, and had their antidepressants

of the first session of the app, depression level, medication side effects and
depression severity were measured using the PHQ-9, FIBSER and BDI-II
questionnaires respectively. Then participants were randomly allocated to the
intervention and control groups. Participants with PHQ-9 score&gt;5 who
tolerated and adhered to the medication and had no problem using the app were
allocated to the per protocol group, while all others were allocated to the
auxiliary group. The total sample gave an indication of the real-world
population, while the per-protocol group was meant to give a more accurate
picture of the app’s effectiveness. The per-protocol group included 117
participants out of 164. Follow-up measurements were taken at the 9<sup>th</sup>
week (after the intervention) and the 17<sup>th</sup> week (after control
participants had the chance to complete the intervention) to measure the
effectiveness of the intervention compared to baseline.</span></p>

control group on the PHQ (SMD=0.4; p&lt;.001), and 4.1 points lower on the
BDI-II (p=.002) on average. As for the per-protocol sample, the intervention
group scored 1.72 below control on the PHQ-9 with a smaller effect size
(SMD=0.28; p.02), 3.2 points on the BDI-II score (p=.05) and 0.75 points of the
FIBSER score (p=.04). On the 17<sup>th</sup> week there were no differences
between the groups on both samples, with the intervention group maintaining
their gains from the 9<sup>th</sup> week (i.e. the control group benefited from

color:black'>This study has shown the positive effects of the intervention app
Kokoro on both samples, which exemplifies its ability to benefit a wide
population of patients with major depressive disorder. It has also shown some
relief in the burden of side-effects from medications in the per-control
sample, which didn’t appear on the total sample. Additional important points
from the study are the smaller effect in the per-protocol sample, which can be
partly attributed to the higher burden of side-effects in the total sample, and
the fact that 70-80% of participants weren’t remitted after two months. These
show the importance of further research despite the overall positive results.</span></p>

color:black'>I find this study unique among those that were included in the
meta-analysis because of the participation of a clinically diagnosed
population, and the use of the app alongside medicine treatment. Additionally,
this study has a rather high compliance rate in contrast to the low compliance
of the overall sample in the meta-analysis, which allows a better understanding
of the effects of the intervention, while also balancing the effects of dropout
via an intention-to-treat protocol. Overall, I find the transparent and
specific methodology used in this study positive, and I believe it will allow
researchers to replicate and develop it more successfully to shed more light on
the effects of mHealth apps on the MDD patients population. I also find the
finding regarding the effects on subjective perception of side-effects (FIBSER)
very interesting and potentially useful for psychiatrists in the future after
further research of the matter is done.</span></p>
